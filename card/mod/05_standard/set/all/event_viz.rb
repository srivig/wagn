# the events method is a developer's tool for visualizing the event order
# for a given card.
# For example, from a console you might run
#
#   puts mycard.events :update
#
# to see the order of events that will be executed on mycard.
# The indention and arrows (^v) indicate event dependencies.
#
# Note: as of yet, the functionality is a bit rough.  It does not display events
# that are called directly from within other events,
# and certain event requirements (like the presence of a 'current_act') may
# prevent events from showing up in the tree.
